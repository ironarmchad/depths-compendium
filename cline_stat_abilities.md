# Stat Abilities
Stat abilities are the abilities that are picked up by leveling 
stats to level 7 and beyond. They are common to every character,
though they may work differently on a boss than on player 
characters.

## Feats and Super Rounds
Feats and super rounds are available from the start to every
character and are restricted to highest stat minus six per session (one pool that can be used on either). 

**Alternate Rule 1: Story Points** The idea is that instead of a strict per session limit, each player starts with a story point (including the ST) which they can spend to use feats (or change a point of story that wasn't clearly defined before eg. "despite forgetting to specify, I did bring the key that was in storage and we need for this door") A player spent point goes to the ST pool. When the ST uses feats they give a story point to the player with the least points (choose randomly among ties). ST can also reward good role-play by awarding his story points to a player.

**Alternate Rule 2: Player Story Pool** If the players prefer, their points can be a global pool rather than per player. Just make sure that everyone gets along if this is the case.

### Feats
Feats are powerful actions that you can perform that are usually 
impossible. If there is a stat check involved, you can not botch the roll (rolls of 1 are value 1). If there is an opposed check involved the opponent cannot crit (rolls of 6 are just value 6).
Any check or power check for stats of 7+ are given a bonus to roll of stat minus six. Feats are not technically linked to a particular stat, but usually at least one of the checks involved should be one of your 7+ stats.

**Counter Feats** If you are the opposing part of a feat, you can counter a feat with a feat. If you do you get your normal bonus for doing a feat action and you can no longer botch.

### Super Round
If a situation is dire but doesn't really need an impossible action, you can begin a super round instead of using a feat. The super round gives you all of the stat bonuses and prevents botches for the entire round.

## Ninth Level Abilities
Typically at ninth level you are allowed a custom ability, related to the stat, that is very powerful.
