# Defensive Abilities
Defensive or reactionary abilities are any ability that 
is applied as a result of someone else's action. As a general
rule, the ST should not allow more than one to apply against
a single action and certain guidelines should be followed to 
avoid a slow-down of combat.

## Armor
Armor is any ability that reduces received damage and is 
usually an item or natural ability. The flavors are
many and varied.
### Extra Health
This isn't actually reducing damage but any ability that adds
health would be considered armor and should not be allowed 
to stack with other armor. Also armor health should be 
accounted separately from main health pool so that it can
be bypassed by abilities that bypass armor.
