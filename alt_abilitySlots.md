# Alternate Rule: Ability Slots

Traditionally, Depths had a fairly strict set of ability slots that were allowed. In this traditional setting, you would have a number of Natural Abilities (typically passive effects) equal to your highest Physical Stat, a number of Supernatural Abilities (typically active effects) equal to your highest Mental Stat and a set of Items (1 Major and 2 Minor items). Ultimately, people wanted to blur the lines between Natural Abilities and Supernatural Abilities or have more than three items. Rather than make a blurry mess where it is difficult to find things I suggest sorting things by whether it is active or passive and have a general pool of "Slots" for all of these abilities.

## Slots

In order to match traditional Depths, starting characters have 18 slots (this presumes you start with a 7 and a 6 as your highest mental and physical stats, 1 major item and two minor items). Each slot represents an active ability or a minor passive.

## Passive Abilities

Passive abilities are things that cost nothing to use (not necessarily that they have continuous effects). These
 abilities cannot be balanced by a cost to use thus we have to balance them by the number of slots they take up. Generally, 1 slots abilities have very limited situational effects that are moderately powerful) or very minor effects that are active constantly. Obviously to get a more major effect or a more general effect the ability will cost more. 

I recommend that you use passives to rewrite normal mechanics rather than giving minor bonuses or very situational bonuses. This is for two reasons: first there isn't a better place to change normal mechanics (eg. you have twice as much health but never dodge), and second minor or situational bonuses are almost always forgotten. I have found that you would get a better bonus if you write a good lore and the ST decides to reward your good RP than a +1 to rolls in a very specific circumstance that I have seen as traditional Natural Abilities.

## Active Abilities

Active abilities are the things you do that cost some sort of resource, usually FP (think mana bar) or Uses Per Day (like traditional DnD spells). These abilities are balanced by their cost to use, rather than the slots used up. As such they would typically cost 1 slot, though nothing says that a powerful ability might not cost more than one slot.

I recommend trying to be as general as possible for one ability and one cost. For example, rather than have a telekinetic push and telekinetic pull, say that you can move a small object 10ft for 5 fp. 

## Items

Items can do anything actives or passives do, but slightly cheaper in cost due to presumably the item can be stolen
, broken or lost. If you put an item on your sheet as part of level up or character creation, it is understood that
 with the right resources and time you could reproduce it. If the item was a gift from the
  ST or other character, once lost it is gone. Items need to be attuned (use slots) even if they are a gift but this gives you another benefit, you can write a ton of abilities to change out at will (like a spellbook in DnD).
