# General Rule: Game Currency

There are several types of currency regularly available in the Depths that players use for various purposes.

## Money: Bells and Whistles

Traditionally, bells and whistles (100 whistles to a bell) are used to represent spending money for taverns, non
-magical items and supplies. Generally, this kind of currency is used for flavor and the ST can be as strict or loose
 with this as he wants. If your ST decides to use this as real currency then it is up to him/her to not break his own
  economy.

## Experience

Traditionally the real "power" currency in the game is experience (sometimes goes by other names) This currency is
 received at the end of a session usually in increments between 3 to 5 per session. Experience could be spent to level
  up or buy magical items, as well as get rerolls on critical rolls that came out badly. While the exact cost of
   things are dependent on how the ST feels about the different effects, one common scheme would be:
- 5 points for a minor level up (raise a stat by one to a value of less than 7).
- 10 points for a major stat up (raise a stat by one to a value of 7 to 9).
- 15 points for a "ultra" stat up (raise a stat by one to a value of 10 or more.
- 10 points to buy a major magical item
- 5 points to buy a minor magical item
- 1 point for a reroll

## Alternate Rule: Medium Level Currency (Kazoo)

I have used a medium level currency that couldn't buy level-ups but could buy things that would take an inconvenient amount of Bells and Whistles (like spaceship upgrades). I found that it might be a good idea to off-load some of what experience can do into a more rigorously watched currency, but one not as rare as experience. The primary things I would offer for this mid-level currency is: 
- Trainers that could do minor level ups, because it is never a good use of experience to raise a minor stat, but it could make role-play sense and you don't really want players on different levels of major stat ups.
- Magical Items in the shop: If you decide to design a few items as the ST you might want to make them cost something other than experience because of how unlikely a player is to spend rare experience on anything other than level ups.
- Mission Helpful Items: Often players will have a base or transport system of their own and if they do they may wish to add mechanically useful things to it. For that you need some control over how much they add but you can't really expect players to give up experience for group benefits; experience is personal, money isn't...

## Alternate Rule: Experience When Using Ability Slots

One rule I have suggested is a slot based ability system that allows far more freedom of adding items to character sheets. This will change how experience works for items(you would have to "buy" your item twice if items cost experience for both the item and requires a slot that you get with level up). I recommend that you use a mid-level currency to pay for crafting of items in this case and not experience. 

## Alternate Rule: Inspiration

Inspiration is an alternative to using experience for re-rolls. There are many different systems, the simplest is
 just a separate currency pool for the purpose. I won't go into details here but usually this pool is meant as a reward for good RP.

## Alternate Rule: Level-ups Rather than Experience

If you are following all of these alternate rules, you will realize I have moved basically everything off of the
 Experience system except level ups. This is because level-ups are IMPORTANT and experienced players will pretty much
  only use Experience for level-ups and re-rolls, only if it will save their character's life. Thus I believe it is
   easier to not use experience at all. I prefer to reward level-ups directly for reaching story goals. This way all of your characters will be roughly equal in power at all times.
