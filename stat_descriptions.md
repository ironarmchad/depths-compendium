# Stat Descriptions
Stats are used to numerically describe the character you have envisioned. This is, in a way, the
crux of the game, but never forget that your role play and imagination is what makes the game
fun. Build the character of your dreams and work with your Story Teller(ST) to make the numbers 
fit.

It is important to note that stats have a somewhat real world equivalent, to a point. Stats run
from 1 - 10 (higher is possible depending on the ST). A 1 means critically deficient, you should
never have a stat of 1 but a stat may be temporarily lowered to 1. A 2 is badly deficient for a 
healthy adult, for example a child will likely have a 2 in strength. A 3 is the weak end of 
average, such as a couch potato would have a 3 in Speed to represent that they can move with 
reasonable quickness but are a bit below average. A 4 is the strong side of average, most 
physical stats of someone who casually works out will be 4. A 5 would indicate that you use that
attribute as part of a profession, for example a construction worker probably has a 5 in 
Strength. A 6 would indicate peak human attainment, Usain Bolt would have a 6 in Speed. Once 7 
is obtained you have surpassed the capabilities of a human.

In order to be considered for the Depths you have to have at least one stat of 7 or above.

## Physical Stats
These stats describe the physical prowess of the character. If your character is a fantastic 
physical specimen, like a Hercules, you will invest heavily in Physical Stats.

### Strength
Strength is a measure of how easy it is for you to lift heavy things. It also determines the 
power of an physical attack, in most cases.
1. Baby
2. Child
3. Couch Potato
4. Casual Athlete
5. Construction worker
6. Strongman

### Reflex
Reflex is the measure of quickness of reaction and hand-eye coordination. It also determines the 
success of physical attacks as well as used to counter physical attacks.
1. Cripple
2. Typical senior citizen
3. Computer Nerd
4. Casual Badminton Player
5. Professional Football Player
6. Roger Federer

### Vitality
Vitality is a measure of health and resilience and and used to set base health (20 * Vitality = 
Base HP pool)
1.  Aids Victim
2. Anemic Person
3. Office Worker
4. Mother
5. Working Mother
6. 

### Speed
Speed measures quickness of movement and action. It is used to roll for Initiative and 
determines how many 5 ft. tiles you can move if a grid is in use.
1. Crawling Baby
2. Person with a limp
3. Computer Nerd (I am intimately familiar with these, being one, and I am generally slightly 
below average in physical characteristics...)
4. Casual Athlete
5. Marathon Runner
6. Usain Bolt

### Awareness
Awareness is how able to observe and utilize these observations. It is typically used to determine the power of physical ranged attacks.
1. 
2. A person who is missing one of their senses (though other senses can make it up).
3. 
4.
5.
6.
7. Hawkeye

## Mental Stats
Mental Stats represent the mental capabilities or even powers of a person. This is where the 
supernatural becomes apparent and even godly powers get involved. Usually the highest of these 
stats forms the FP pool (10 * Highest Mental Stat).

### Willpower
Willpower measures the ability to persist in a task no matter the strain, opposition or cost. 
While in natural humans, this merely a state of mind, in the Depths it can involve much more, 
such as creating manifestations of the will or changing ones body though pure will. This stat is 
used most often to defend yourself from magical attacks.

### Attunement
Attunement measures how connected a person is to the environment. In natural humans this never 
goes beyond precognition or a sense that someone is watching, but taken beyond that it may

### Imagination
### Faith
### Luck
### Charisma# Stat Descriptions

## Mental Stats
Mental Stats represent the mental capabilities or even powers of a person. This is where the 
supernatural becomes apparent and even godly powers get involved. Usually the highest of these 
stats forms the Fey Points(FP) pool (10 * Highest Mental Stat) which represents the magical
energy of your character.

### Willpower
Willpower measures the ability to persist in a task no matter the strain, opposition or cost. 
While in natural humans, this merely a state of mind, in the Depths it can involve much more, 
such as creating manifestations of the will or changing ones body though pure will. This stat is
used most often to defend yourself from magical attacks.

### Attunement
Attunement measures how connected a person is to the environment. In natural humans this never 
goes beyond precognition or a sense that someone is watching, but taken beyond that it may 
involve pulling energy from the environment or changing your environment because of the link
between you and your surroundings. Usually the Attunement stat is used like perception except
for specifically magical sensations, as such it is usually not worth investing in if your 
character isn't using it as one of their primary stats.

### Imagination
Imagination measures the ability for a person to think their way around problems and create 
things. While the creative ability of humans is already impressive, when taken beyond normal
human ability Imagination may directly affect the form of supernatural occurrences. Imagination 
is used by default for crafting and learning, but is not typically called for unless you used it
on your own character sheet.

### Faith
Faith measures the ability to call on supernatural aid from another source. Typical Depths 
allow for any Pantheon to coexist so it is for the player to determine what this means for 
their character. One theme that is consistent is usually Faith characters call on their 
supernatural abilities using a times per day schema rather than an FP cost.

### Luck
Luck measures how favored a character is by the universe. Usually a luck is used to determine 
things happening by chance rather than an act of will. Thematically, it is recommended that 
the results of luck abilities have a random nature to them, and perhaps a different cost scheme.

### Charisma
Charisma measures your characters ability to use elocution to solve problems. Charisma was 
implemented with the understanding that the player may not be as charismatic as their character,
but some STs may decide not to use the stat or to supplement the roll with bonuses based on what 
the player said.
