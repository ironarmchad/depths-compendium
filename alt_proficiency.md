# Alternate Rule: Proficiency

One of the failings of traditional Depths is that the Reflex stat was far too important, because it was used for almost all success checks involved in physical attacks. Most STs were very good about allowing magical attacks to use whatever combination of stats that the player wanted, but if you were a physical fighter you had to raise Reflex. This also created a problem for STs when the party has drastically different Reflex scores. Making a boss difficult to hit for your highest Reflex character often made it impossible to hit for everyone else. 

One solution to the problem is to create a system of proficiency. The concept is that when your ability is more of a result of training than natural talent you would use your proficiency instead of a raw stat roll.

## Proficiency as a Natural Ability
If using proficiency as natural abilities, each declared proficiency uses up natural ability slots on this scheme:

1. One slot for exchanging success checks to proficiency.
1. One slot for exchanging power checks to proficiency.
1. Double slots for exchanging any normally physical check for a mental check (and the reverse).

Examples:

Say someone wants to make a barbarian that uses two-handed axes but generally has low Reflex (because he absorbs hits rather than dodges them) and high Strength. They would add an a natural ability to their sheet to specify that for any two handed, hafted, slashing, melee weapons they roll Strength for their success roll rather than Reflex. This cost 1 slot due to only exchanging the success from one physical stat to another.

Say someone wants to play a bard with high Reflex and high Charisma but low strength (typical melee power stat) and low awareness (typical precision power stat). They could have an ability to exchange rapier's power stat for Charisma (when using proficiency rule it doesn't have to make sense as it is representing training not actually using Charisma to improve rapier damage). This would cost two natural slots because he is only exchanging power checks but it is from a physical to a mental stat.

Finally, lets say someone wants to play a pure squishy wizard who has magical fists. Typically punching requires a Reflex success check and a Strength power check, but this wizard wants to move both to his Imagination. His proficiency ability is for both success and power so two slots and he is exchanging from physical to mental thus cost is doubled. Thus he would spend four natural slots.

## Declared Proficiency
Instead of having natural abilities, you could instead have proficiency stats declared in this scheme:
- Physical Success
- Physical Power
- Mental Success
- Mental Power
Each proficiency must be a different stat. The player gets to declare a certain number of actions as proficient (perhaps 5, it hasn't been playtested yet so use the STs disgression). Natural abilities can add more actions to the proficiency list. If you are proficient use the appropriate proficiency stat rather than the normal stat.
